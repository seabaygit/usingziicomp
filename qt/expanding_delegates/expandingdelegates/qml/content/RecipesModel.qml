                  If you are using a desktop device please go to the bottom right corner, position
                  your mouse on it and drag diagonally. It will increase the size of the screen at
                  your will.<br>
                   What follows applies to all devices.
                   The application will have  arrows on the right of the text when there is more text than the
                   one that is shown in the screen.
                   This is applicable to the main menu where you see the different
                            clickable buttons or when you see the menu items in detail.
                            You can browse the text by maintaing Ctrl key pressed and
                            clicking on the arrow and then dragging up or down . Do
                            not release the arrow that you click when dragging. You can go on dragging
                            beyond the boundaries of the window of the application. Without releasing the mouse at any time.
                            If you see two arrows in the bottom right corner it means that you are
                            seing the main frame and an interior one. Take the inner one as reference.
                            An arrow pointing downwards implies dragging upwards and viceversa.

                   <p> This book was created in the beginning, as a way to concentrate my sanity in a nightmarish situation.
                       Also in honor to the education that my parents and two countries gave me. All of them were under attack
                       when I arrived to an airport and a climate of extreme violence was created around me. I was explicitly told
                       that I was going to die while at the airplane. In the beginning, when I arrived to the airport it looked
                       like too much, but when I suffered the sequel of the airplane at the airport - at a higher level - and I was
                       attacked by psychotronic weapons as soon as I left the terminal, I changed my mind and regrettably, my normal
                       world went away. I dived back to the terminal in complete panic.Other people under the same circumstances have died or are in a hospital now.
                    </p>
                    <p> You can find a series of techniques which are currently applied over a wide spectrum of the population and not commonly revealed.
                      <b> Some of these methods are very dangerous for both the health of your body and your mind.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p> All the information of the book is based on real facts and scientifically proven. If the reader focuses on the information
                       provided will understand that there are a number of factors acting upon him / her that can seriously affect the health that all
                       human beings are entitled to. The problem is that all is invisible. In the kaos that is created, those who apparently attack in
                       fact are sometimes helping. And those who apparently are helping are really attacking. There are two kind of firefighters, the ones
                       who are brave and risk their lives and protect you. And the ones who start a fire or pay for a fire to start and then seem to be carrying out
                       their job. This book, hopefully, will help you to know who is who.

                   <p>I first visited Canada invited by Val who at that moment was my girl-friend. We had been dating for about six months or more before ,
                       while she had been visiting the USA. At that time she told me that she was trying to open a .com company in Santa Monica and was
                       looking for personnel for the company.
                    </p>
                     <p> I was working in a hotel in Long Beach, which was for me a temporary job while I tried to get
                       a foot into Long Beach University, where I applied for an Oracle Database position more or less at the time that I knew her. I had also
                       visited the Department of Mathematics and explored the possibilities of job there, as well the Post-graduate department, where I wanted
                       to spend a grant of $5,000 that I had earned while working for Americorps.
                      </p>
                      <p>At that time, also I had attended a conference about Qt that
                       took near the Long Beach Airport. In a way, my going to the conference served a dual purpose, First: what I had been developing in Debian,
                       Second: The Department of Mathematic's chief had told me that the only thing he was interested in at that moment were people who
                       knew embedded languages and the Qt platform was the nearest known thing that I had at hand to get into embedded programming.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In parallel with all this I had also focused in PHP/MySQL/Ajax/JavaScript and that is the technology that I showed Val as something that
                        I could work for in the company. Apparently it was a good fit for her and she hired me as Vice Director of Technology. At that time we were
                        not dating yet.
                       </p>
                  </p>
                        <p> At the time of this first time arrival she had told me that there was a possibility that she were pregnant, according to the symptoms that
                        she had experienced - she had like fainted at the airports sometimes. </p>
                       <p> I had several conversations with Pat, who would later would be my mother in law. She always behaved like a very polite and intelligent lady,
                          very careful about the future of the family. It looked like a good environment and the character of the people of Edmonton was good. So I
                          started to think of a new life with Val and her family. It made a perfect sense.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        No wonder, in one of the trips that I made to Canada I brought books that I considered would instruct me about how the political situation was in the USA
                        , there were many things in that area which I ignored. I knew that I was an extremely technical person and that I did not have knowledge of many things that were going on
                        in the country. I strongly believe that these books were among the main reasons for me to be targeted when I came back to the States. Together
                        with the fact that I also started to explore videos and literature informing about 9/11 that were not frequently found in the libraries of the USA, but
                        were common information in Canadian ones. The books were Against All Enemies, The book of Al Gore about Global Warming and another book about how
                        the extreme right church was influencing the political spectrum of the country.
                   </p>
                   <p> An additional factor was that my computer was not returned to me when I came back in one of the trips. It delayed a considerable number of days.
                       It happened to other passengers that were in the same flight that I had taken to Canada. It was a flight with a stop. It was in the stop where
                       the stopping of the luggage of the passengers took place.
                   </p>
                    <p><u><b>Important events </b></u></p>
                    <p> I asked Val's mother, Pat if a condition that she had was in the degree of extreme before marrying her. I simply said that if she reached that condition
                      I would not marry her immediately. Did not say anything else. I was told that she did not reach the condition, that tests had been made and she had been told by the
                      doctor that she did not reach that level. Two weeks after arriving from our honeymoon, Val took me to the doctor woman and she told me completely the contrary. The
                      test had proven that she reached the extreme, that really
                      shocked me.  And I started asking myself questions. First of all - why was that happening?.
                    </p>
                    <p> The doctor gave me a booklet in silence when I was leaving the office. The book explained the
                      details of the extreme conditon and how it had transformed the lives of many couples. There was a conclusion to extract from the attitude of the doctor and the content
                      of the book. I had to make a decision. I thought for about a week. I was just a matter of thinking about me and leaving the marriage or staying. I decided to love Val and
                      stay. From that moment on I just tried to fix things and not read more about what the book explained. I do not think that I was wise.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                      Several events that took place before and after our message certainly can be explained through the explanations that the doctor gave me. As a matter of fact, it is the only
                      conclusion to, what I am going to refer to as 'sudden changes' of behavior. Unfortunately, this condition can be inherited. One of the biggest pain in Val's life was
                      to struggle with this fact. And I did not realize about that. From that moment on, practically, she fell into a state of dreaming at least 14 hours a day. I took care of the
                      food and entertaining the kids until around 10:00 AM when she woke up. This was going to have specific consecuences that I do not consider proper to explain here.
                    </p>
                    <p> While visiting FL, arriving from Bahamas, I went to South Beach briefly to say hellow to all people that I had known in the area and were accessible in a short
                        period of time. Two things happened in that opportunity, first, the checks that Val had given to me had no backing, my account had negative numbers for the first time
                        since I had created it. Second, while going to join with Val and her mother at Alton Road a young man addressed me in Lincoln Road, on the way to Alton Road, and
                        said that - we are going to kill you, he signaled to his neck and made a killing gesture, as shooting.  It was really graphic and I spent days, after getting back to
                        Canada, what was all about. I had been out the area for about 2 years, I was wondering what kind of hate could have exist in someone against me after such a periond of time.
                        When I met Val and her mother at Alton Road, I was really concerned when I met them and from that moment on, one strange premonition in me remained associated to that threat.
                        Another thing that happened at that time I went to the Bank of America located at Lincoln Road and Washington Ave. The money that I had put in the bank as a result of the checks
                        that Val had given me in payment as a subdirector of the company was not there. For the first time I had a negative balance in my account.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      When we left Miami Beach, with me still thinking about the man who had threatened me, we were victim of a very racist action. I prefer to talk about this later. The area, though,
                      was very well known for issues related to racial discrimination. In at least two occasions it had happened to me before. I realized then, only partially, that as we were an interracial
                      couple we would have to face situations in several places. I do not think that I spent enough time and went deep enough into this. They did things that apparently drove the people out
                      of their minds sometimes, so racist they were. At the moment that I am writing, I feel that I was not capable to perceive how racist some people and communities are in Florida.
                     </p>
                     <p> While staying in Canada I received some pictures of my family. I was scared of what I saw. I had never seen my parents so thin. I had already been very concerned about
                      the fact that they were not present in the wedding ceremony. As is usual in our island. So I decided that I had to take care of my family at that very moment. And I asked the person
                      who had sent the pictures what was better, to go to Cuba immediately or go to the States and finish the citizenship. I was told that if I went back to Cuba maybe I would not be allowed
                      to leave the country, so I started to make plans to be employed by a company in the States and comeback. I contacted and talked with different potential employers. When one company in
                      Santa Monica offered an interview I came back and went to the interview. Val took me to the airport with the kids.
                     </p>
                     <b><u><p>2008 - I came back </b></u><br>
                         And what I found out was not agreeable. I landed in Fort Lauderdale and the fist strange thing that I experienced was that a man that had taken the plane in Atlanta did not stop
                         talking bad things about me. He took all the sequence of buses that I took since srriving to the airport until arriving to Miami Beach. Not stopping trying to bias everybody
                         against me, as if he had been paid for doing that. Also in the first bus that I took in Fort Lauderdale a black man that sat down near me told me that one day I was going to
                         have an accident. My mind started to get even more worried - terrorized - than when I had left LA. And I think that it was the moment tha a sort of disbelieve entered me - very
                         dangerous - I thought sometimes that they were not talking about me, some other times that it was a sort of television show created. In a way I was right, but it was creaed
                         to kill me, I could not easily accept it in my mind. There was already, at that moment, a very serious attack of the media on me, I simply could not accept it in my mind. People
                         were making money out of hate songs against me that instigated to my physical elimination. </p>

                  As soon as I arrived I went to the office of the company that was going to interview me. After the interview the person in charge - not the one that I was
                  supposed to meet though - told me that I could take care a test immediately. I had been travelling for about 8 hrs. I told him that I preferred to take the test next day
                  and eat at that moment because I was tired after the interview. He did not respond to my call the next morning and he did not respond to my emails from that moment on.

                  I was in the process of applying for other companies when I received a call from Val. We had been talking several times before on the phone. This time the call was different.
                  Do not want to get into details here. I was surprised and started to ask me questions again. There were several people from Canada in the hostel. There was a Canadian girl, black,
                  extremely well educated and brilliant in her behavior. She talked with me about the call and she explained me things that at that moment did not make too much sense too me.
   Very serious things.                </p>

                  <p><u><b>Arrival </u></b><br>
                     Arrived to this place around 2001. Started to leave at 7955 Collins. This was a nice place near the beach.
                     It was also the first place where I perceived something that I could not understand as possible. I felt that
                     tbere were people like watching me from the adjacent room and commenting about my activities. At that time I considered
                     it extremely unlikely to happen. I found out, in different occasions, that people had entered my room, under
                     different pretexts. The manager of the building found an excuse, in two occasions - after the incidents . I consulted with
                     the Surfside police about that.</b>

                     </p> <p>I believe that at some point I made a police report in this department. After that I moved
                     to different places and made numerous police reports always due to the same reason, home intrusion. In one opportunity
                     I was able to see, while living at Washington street, how somebody left the room through the window - I made a report about this.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Another time I was able to record five men accessing my bathroom while reparing it. After that I remember that the flow of water
                     in the shower was very thin - I was leaving across the Delano Hotel at that
                     time. Years after this incident, I heard of people installing devices in showers and irregular work of devices after that.
                     One more time while leaving in Washington - and renting a hotel room - I heard the voice of a man, Martin - who had been
                     about to be arrested while I was a supervisor at Hispaniola Way due to sexual offense - making comments as if he were seeing me
                     while at the bathroom. It was, again, something that was out of the boundaries of what I considered possible. No wonder I made
                     a comment about this to a person that I do not want to mention here, exactly at the moment that it happened and in three other opportunities.
                     it was just something too out of the ordinary.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     In another unforgettable moment I was able to record five men accessing my bathroom while reparing it - I was leaving across the Delano Hotel at that
                     time. One more time while leaving in Washington - and renting a hotel room - I heard the voice of a man, Martin - who had bean
                     about to be arrested while I was a supervisor at Hispaniola Way due to sexual offense - making comments as if he were seeing me
                     while at the bathroom. It was, again, something that was out of the boundaries of what I considered possible. No wonder I made
                     a comment about this to a person that I do not want to mention here , when I occurred.
                     </p>
                    <p> At this moment in my life I think that I should
                    have followed up all these incidents in a more detailed and serious way. I was - and I am - unaware of the way criminal groups
                    work. But blackmail seems to be one of their strong points. And long memory. I feel that all these events could be connected
                    to the theats that I received from T. - you are going to commit suicide  and A. - I will put your picture all over the world -
                    in 2001 and 2000 respectively. I had heard of retailation but I had never suspected the ways it takes place. Both incidents were mentioned
                    and documented in the records of recognized organizations in  USA.
                    <p>At that time consequently, I had been targeted by organized crime. There were people who - unknown to me - danced in the clubs, any kind of
                    clubs you went to, mixed in the crowd. But they apparently were not dancers, but rather like enforcers of opinions. I wanted to be a DJ and visited
                    a number of clubs, exploring the music and the environments, without any specific attachment to any club and without belonging to any specific group.
                    Most of the time I spent in Miami Beach was living alone. My main concern were get deep into Linux, music, use my synthesizer to create music, etc.
                    I was the perfect victim for this kind of people, who apparently entered in your room and monitored your life to create movies or something worse</p>
                     <p>It was a mixture of criminals and people who supplied them with means and devices that criminals usually do not have</p>
                    <p> It is obvious for me that I had been targeted by criminal groups. Documents disappeared from the room and there was a special
                     emphasis in accessing my storage place and take away any pictures that I had taken of my life. Specially in New York. I was always
                     curious about this. But it looked impossible, again, at that time, that your storage place was searched and robbed. But it happened.
                     At some point, though, things reached an extreme and I made a report to the Fort Lauderdale office of Public Storage due to the
                     strange behavior - and the robbing of a synthesizer in the premises - that I had suffered in 8/2005 while preparing my luggage
                     to move to California. In this strange event the person that was apparently renting the space adjacent to the No 179, on the right,
                     was present while I was packaging and made strange comments, while another guy located at the end of the corridor and seating on a small
                     chair, an old man, laughed at the comments. The employees of the storage place also behaved disrespectfully. In a way I feel that I had
                    been the victim of a group of criminals that I could not identify. The synthesizer dissapeared from the entrance of the building in
                     two seconds. There was a suspicious individual seating at the entrance of the building too.

            <p><b><u>Attacks</p></b></u></br>
             This image was taken from the video that I made at the Hotel Claremont, Miami Beach, 2008. The man at the chair did not stop talking about transsexual who had been shot here and there.
             The men in the back of the picture were part of the team of the lobby. There was another team at terrace, near the sidewalk, with the explicit mission of attracting the
             attention of every human being that passed by towards me and reinforce the notion that I was a person who belonged to this category. In the meantime, at the lobby they carried out the same
             task with the people inside of the hotel and, late in the evening the activated devices that produced real sounds of guns shot. Joshua was complicit in all this. He smiled.
             <p>I made calls to the police and to the FBI. When the police came, they talked to Joshua, not to me. Joshua smiled and told lies. He seemed to be in intimate knowledge of everything that was happening.</p>
           <p><b>Hotel Claremont </b></p>

<p>First picture describes the position of team 1 and one of the guys who, at the lobby seemed to be in control of the situation there. He made jokes about sex and how certain people had been shot.
Gerai, in the background , talked to him in the same direction. It was a very tense and dark situation.
</p>
<p>Second and third pictures give an idea of where team 2 was located. Redirecting the attention of everybody who passed by the sidewalk towards me with hate comments and showing media in their phones.
</p>
<p>
Fourth and Fifth picture represent the places where harassment and beating took place.
</p>
<p>
These two pictures represent places where I was harassed and beaten in Miami Beach. In another document
I will give details about the perpetrators of these actions.
</p>
<p>
The last one represents the place where a man who was sleeping
 - or pretending to sleep - near me while homeless, beat me and broke my glasses. There was another man, apparently very sick, sleeping
nearby. </p>

                   <li> 2008. A mixture of people carrying out all kinds of harassment while at the terminal.
                   <li> Use of different kinds of audio devices - hi tech - for desorientation as soon I tried to leave the terminal.
                   <li> Frightened by these actions I get back to the terminal and stay there for a week. Starts my desorientation.
                   <li> I strongly feel that the guys responsible for all these actions were not from San Francisco but, at that time, I thought that all aggressions were local.
                        It is impossible to describe the effect that the cold temperatures, when you do not have the proper clothing, has on you. It is like an ongoing torture
                        that little by little starts dominating all of your actions. The only thing that you think of, when it is getting cold, it is how to protect yourself
                        from the temperature, since you do not have the proper resources, you start inventing things like changing the position of the body, going to unprotected places that
                        look as if they could protect you even though it were a little against the wind and the cold. All of the time you spend thinking about that. Add the fact that they
                        have made you believe that your parents are dead and that you are HIV positive.

                   <li> Spent some time out in the terminal's shuttle area - around 15 days - and then moved painfully to South San Francisco.
                   <li> In the meantime, a lot of people were making money singing hate songs about me.

                 <p> Immobilization at the airport was achieved by using GangStalking outside, plus the cooperation of a massive number of
                     employees and people with special skills biasing them against me. In different opportunities there were death threats.</p>
                  <p> My behavior changed while taking into account what had happened in the other airports and adding the new set of situations created in
                    the last one.</p>
                  <p> The criminal distraction was used when, adding to the sexual subject that was being developed, they started to spread around false information about
                    my family and my attitude towards the family. From this moment on, they have used my family in a number of occasions to disrupt my thread of thoughts.
                    Perhaps I should have written about this a long time ago, to give a better picture about the nature of those involved in all this.
                  </p>
                  <p> The effect of all the methodologies used in the above described sections had the effect of freezing the person who was submitted to this treatment. I ended up
                      wandering about the whole airport. First the shuttles, I took one shuttle after the other; then the stairways, where I started to sleep. When I asked if there was
                      any shelter around I was told that only in San Francisco. When in fact the Bay Harbour shelter was near the airport. Apparently this was done due to the sex attacks.
                  </p>
                   <p>I spent like seven days inside of the terminal and fifteen around the airport before being told about the Bay Harbor shelter. Sleeping in the stairways was difficult.
                      In many occasions they placed a car, usually a small truck near the place where I tried to sleep and then they played hate songs, mostly hip-hop at that time. Later
                      other type of musical movements joined the campaign, but this was long after the airport events.
                <p>
                   Once they have you immobilized, they start to work with the criminal groups to harass you to the point of desperation, where anything can happen to your mental stability or
                   your health. Money is of paramount importance at that moment, that is why people who do not have the support of their family or are not wealthy become homeless. Nobody would like
                   to live the life of a homeless, there it is easier for the guys that want to destroy you access you, your property, etc. And they can influence the people in places like dormitories
                  and where you get your food in such a manner that your life becomes very misserable. And then your whole world dissapears and you enter the world that they have created for you.
                  <br>
                   At the time that I was attacked in this way, there were practically no regulations in what refers to sex in important sectors of the life of the society. So people in those sectors
                   thought they could abuse freely of people accused or perceived as belonging to the LGBT.
                  </p>
                   <p>To make the matter still more complicated, I have seen and heard LGTB people collaborating with those who want to destroy me. Others have been very polite and have warned me and explained
                    about the way that the different layers of the society interact. Something absolutely unknown by me. I realized that since most of my life was spent in big and liberal areas, there was a lot
                    of misperception about what the rest of this country was. Besides, the country itself changed so much that even the citizens were stranged at the things that were and are happening. I feel, again
                    that I have been selected as a <b>Target of Opportunity</b> in the context of a political revenge.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      As soon as I arrived to the airport my first thought was, how do I figure out a way to join to my family, which was the objective that I had when I arrived from Canada.
                      I called a religious person from the airport and started to figure out the way to get some money to survive until I could get a ticket and go to New York. When I saw what was happening at the
                      airport <b>I decided not to stay in San Francisco </b> that is what happened after that was to force a person to stay in the area.
                      <b>Mastering communications in total way during the interactions of that person with the environment. People included. Everything was distorted and manipulated at the will of those
                        who wanted to retain me there and destroy me with methods absolutely unknown to me. These methods were applied alongside the whole Bay Area.

                   </p>
                   <p> And another big advantage they had was that I absolutely ignored who my enemies were and thought that everything that was happening to me in different places was local.
                   </p>
                   <p>From the moment that I was forced to stay in this area on, I have represented business for different groups with different agendas. Always using superior monitoring, they have been able
                     to destroy everything that I want to construct. Including my health. It is the first time in my life that I am afraid of going to a hospital to take care of my health, <b>due to multiple bad experiences</b>.

                   <p> Before moving out of the area of the aiport I make an effort to make sense out of what was happening to me. I started to faint on the floor and remain there
                     motionless, whatever happened. First time this happened outside of the airport was at Burlingame. There I spent the night near a hotel at the coast, outside.
                     In the evening the water system rained on me and I could not move - so tired and frightened I was - and the employees laughed at me while observing. One of them
                     said that the water was poisoned and I, completely frightened, went the next morning to see the administrator. He told me that the water was bad but not poisoned.

                    <p>
                      At the time that I am writing this - 2012 - I believe that there was a complot orchestrated, somewhere  before I arrived to these areas. And by very powerful people,
                      to create a fictitious persona of me. And that many people, for one reason or another, were synchronized with that. They way that the whole thing affected me was this: <b>an
                      immense psychological attack </b>.
                    </p>
                    <p> During that evening several guys were around me saying that I made their task of killing me easier by staying outside of the hotel.</p>

                     <p>Next thing I did was going to the Westin nearby and ask for some help to verify if my parents were dead or not. I asked to see somebody in the hotel
                     who could help me with that. Next thing that happened was that they called the police. The officer did not pay any attention to what I was saying, said that he had
                     a friend that could help me and, all of the sudden a car came and I was told that I had no choice, <b>that I had to get into the car </b>. They took me to the hospital to
                     undergo a drugh test and be analyzed by a psychiatrist. There I heard things that gave me the impression that, for some reason, they considered me some sort of sex
                     problem, they mentioned Europe and looked at me really weird. From that moment on, during a long time, any complaint was directed to the psychiatrist, the guys who were
                     harassing and attacking me in many places, sometimes using very sophisticated devices and techniques, did not exist. The songs instigating to my death, widely disregarded, I was
                     leaving in one world and they were living in another.</p>
                    <p>There were several things that most of the population of the area believed when I was there </p>
                     <ul>
                     <li> I was HIV positive.
                     <li> I was a person who had had some sort of sex career.
                     <li> My parents were dead and I had laughed when they had died. This was continuously reinforced by the criminals with songs and street theater.
                     <li> There were more lies orchestrated - as far I could see at that moment - at the Hotel Claremont, where there had been such attacks that I had to take the decision of leaving the hotel and the area.
                     </ul>


       <p><b><font size=4> The location of the tree was near a power plant. I stayed there, isolated,  most of the time. Thinking of how I had been contaminated with HIV.</b></font> How it was possible. Was it my wife?. She looked very healthy. I had had no sexual contact with anybody else
            . When had it happened?<br>
        I spent so much time thinking about this that my mind practically left this world. Everyday was waiting for a new symptom. I guess that this is the moment in which my behavior changed radically </p>

<p><b> Obviously I made attempts to leave the area. Only to be rejected by the population in ways very aggressive. Sometimes before arriving the area there were people that somehow, knew that I was arriving and screamed for me not to reach their neighborhood.
</b></p>
       <p> The only solution that I had was to leave this country, and that was my next move.</p>
       <p> What I found was <b><font size=4> blocking of communications and of money going to the bank</b></font>. Because of the sensitivity of this information I will be very short. But it happened and I documented it timely.
           My perception at this moment is that, with a variety of methodologies, all unknown to me, the main objective was not let me leave the country and submit me to different tactics to destroy me in character and physically. It is only due to a miracle that I can write these words,
          they have orchestrated everything so well, and I have been so isolated and attacked, that at this moment, according to their plans I would be taking dangerous medicines in a hospital. I felt so bad taking those medicines that I sent myself into research. And that is how I
          explain what is happening to me now. But they were able to deteriorate me so much that physically I still suffer a lot.
       </p>
       <p> It is only <b><font size=4> After certain time </b></font> that you start thinking why there was so much interest in destroying you as a person. I think that I was taken as a proxy for a sex campaign and that my status as immigrant helped the attackers, since I was going to
           be used to deter people from doing certain things, attending certain places, and they were going to dehumanize me to the extreme. I felt that, somehow, my privacy had been violated, but when I requested information I was never informed. It happened several times. It was also remarkable
           from those moments on, <b><font size=3>the actions of 'Vigilantes' making my life misserable. This happened in different counties..</b></font>

                   that some of them decided to make a plan that allowed me to get partially on my feet, but not to get paid or make money.
                   <li> Asked in several places about what was going on with me. Went to the airport, police, called the FBI, called Department of Justice.
                   <li> The same as when I arrived and talked about the people harassing me. All times I was sent to the doctor- psychiatrist - as if I were out of my mind.
                   <li> When I went to the hospital - forced to stay - they gave me Risperdal And Geodon. Things did not get better. Memory and health deeply affected. Now diabetes took a toll on me.
                   <li> It was not only the memory. Ones feels really bad, desoriented, static.
                   <li> My teeth started to torture too. Spent around seven months to get Medical. First registration to Medical was missing three months after doing the registration at the hospital.
                   <li> The building was bombarded by sounds - stating that I was HIV positive among other things, the machines promoted what the operators wanted to be my sexual orientation. This happened
                        a lot of time. So I believed that I was really sick and there was not much time left in this world.
                   <li> <b>When I returned to the parking lot they ignored what had happened at the hospital. So I was worse than when I left but I could not explain them the reasons. Not in the state I was </b>.
                    <li> I have described in several places what happened at the parking lot with the microwaves or whatever kind of technique that was used on me. In particular I was curious about the fact that
                     the intensity of the attacks was greater after the labour hours. At the time of this writing 05/21/2012 I realize that the intensity can be strongly associated with how I felt, and the the
                      tireness that I felt, together with very rigid sensation in the extremities , was nothing casual or imagined by me, but the result of the attack to which I was submitted. But there is another
                      detail important about variation of intensity; in the first days that I spent at the parking lot, when I slept in the cars, I was practically forced to leave a car because of the extreme intensity
                      of the attack, that day I slept on the open air to avoid been practically cooked inside of the car.

                 First method that was applied on me - with overwhelming negative results -<b><font size=4> was to make me believe I was HIV positive - at an airport -</b></font> is that normal?
                   Second method that was used was to make me believe that my parents were dead. They really enjoyed that. I still remember the International Fligts Floor at San
                   Francisco International Airport and me asking to the man who is in charge of the only stand there: Sir, they are saying that my parents are dead. And he saying, go
                   to the police and then, when I turn my back, he is saying to other person: He is crazy , everybody knows that his parents are death. <br>

                             Victims have been selected taking into account their economic status since the beginning it is assured that there will be no serious consequences. Maybe that is why I am trying to find the truth in all this.

Abou and Ryad were the ones who made these comments, as well as some patients. So from that moment on I started to

                         was 2009 and it was a multirracial group. I was trying to sleep in San Francisco near the Canton Restaurant.
                         In my blurred mind I think that they were around me and joked and made comments, usually during the evening.
                         <li> The woman that , around 2009-2010 said:<b><font size=4> I am going to empty my gun in this nigger </b></font>. When I was

                           she was white, slender and the hair semi-red.
                         <li> There were guys standing across the parking lot or near the place where they sell yogurt. They were singers
                           who assigned me nicknames and said a lot of things about me.
                          <li> There were frequently guys near where I made my phone calls to listen or bother. The public phones started
                            to dissapear around and beyond the parking lot. Also when I took the bus they were frequently harassing. Always the same type
                            of people. A culture had been created around me.

                          <li> Among the people who have been watching me and destroying my life there are at least two women. They are white and cruel.
                               Enjoy making me suffer when I am sleeping as homeless. They play with the word death in their comments to frighten me and
                               to let the audience know the fate that they have prepared for me. I would like that an International Investigation on Human Rights
                               found out who these women were.

                            At that time there was no goverment policy considering the issue of the transsexualism and it was still implemented the - Don't Ask, Don' Tell - policy.
                            Since there was an evident desire to make an example with me, all the weight of the lack of regulations in these two different fields fell on me. It should
                            also taken into account that there was an evident desire to make all what happened with me a political issue too.</p>

                            <li> There is an evident conspiracy in not acknowledging my skills in software. It has happened in several occasions. In Daily City a man saying
                                that I did not complete a project for him in Wordpress. I feel that somehow this guy was serving somebody because I found him in suspicious
                                circumstances in Redwood City, did not want to accept any option that I gave him and followed me with his wife in a car up to Palo Alto. He
                                behaved as if he had been paid for it. Later on in Watsonville, my evaluator did not know Joomla and discovered that it was written in JavaScript
                                and said that he was testing me; besides he like to play songs with sexual content when I was present. I have the title of the songs in the Internet.
                                The use of music - in different languages - has been one of the weapons that the haters have been using against me.
                          </ul>


                 I feel that dangerous people had targeted me since a long time ago and that I was not capable of finding out on time. A had a mental collapse and only recently recovered.</p>
                 <p><b>Not taking the pills was one factor. I have to find out about this, and I have talked to some lawyers about that. But I don't event know how to start. Until recently I was still forgetting things.</p>
                 <p><b> I have to find out about who spread the false news at the airport and in the subsequent days - events that transformed my whole life. Also all the false atmospheres created by the media and other people.
                 </p>
                 <p> <b>Not a single day of my life I have practiced a sexual act in exchange for money. I strongly believe that these people will try to eliminate me to leave no trace of their wrongdoing. They have done it before.</p>
                 <p> <b>All points to very powerful people, retailation and treason. <p>
                 <p><b> My health has been seriously impacted. Physically and in what refers to side effects, the memory and some sort of static behavior that only recently started to fade off.
                 <p>It has been particularly damaging
                 the use  of non-lethal weapons. Sometimes they made me scream of pain in the evenings. They can damage your ears and accelerate your heart, I suffered that. These are dangerous individuals. And they have constantly
                 promoted violence around me.</p>

                    <p> I am in doubt that it is really our of the ordinary what has happened to me.
                        I have read about a lot of cases where Virtual Data destroyed life by missusing information. It looks like a plan,
                        in certain minds, to conform the way according to their desires. And there had to be a pretext to access the info
                        of people and do business with it. And the pretext was the war. For the young people, who do not know how their
                        country was seen before I have only one expression : Everybody <b><font size=4>Wanted </b></font> to come to the States
                        and few, very few people, had a different opinion. Probably the main point here is that people who do not handle
                        data has <b>NO CLUE </b> about the way information is processed. But it is already time that all people be more responsible
                        about this - and avoid suffering as I have. Do not let everything to the ACLU, but read their website. It might save your
                        life. Do you, for a second, have thought in the number of blackmails that can be structured if information from 40 years ago
                        falls into the wrong hands. Better wake up.

                         they will make some other people laugh at you - cruelly.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another good reason for my insisting in following up with programming is that my health was really bad and that I did not
                     want to let them say - with some reason - that latinos and negro programmers are a matter of science fiction. And besides they managed
                     to create a terribly negative environment in every single place that I tried to have a beginning.
                     </p>
                    <p> I loved my wife, I was happy with her and the kids and thinking that I was going to introduce them to my family. But Virtual
                        Data had other plans. They enjoy more cruelty than the happiness of other human beings. As a matter of fact, happiness is a
                        word almost forbidden in their world. You the readers are smart. Th>ink wether I am write or not and give yourself the answer.
                        I am providing you this information FOR FREE. But it could save your life.
                    </p>
                    <p> Everything that happened from the moment that I went to Ocean Five Hotel on is criminal. Those people were blatantly destroying my
                       life with a powerful authorization. They were simply spreading information and authorizing mistreatment and death threats. And they
                       are doing the same now 2012, after a period of tense relative calm </p>

                        When I arrived I had clear objectives. To have a job related to my specialty and be useful to this country and my family.
                        <b>It is impossible to have done something different from what I have done. I focused my mind in programming to avoid getting crazy and
                         to get back to normal after the pills. A lot of people, in the meantime, have committed suicide for similar reasons, as Tenkasi promissed.
                         Good times for people like him. Now it seems to be that every single intrigue and lie that they created will be allowed. Not for ever though.

Biological Structures Which Can AMPLIFY
Pulsed-Microwave 'Voice to Skull Signals'
Electromagnetic Interaction With Biological Systems
edited by Dr. James C. Lin, University of Illinois

Page 122:
Cooperative Modification of Calcium Binding by RF Fields
at Cell Surfaces with Amplification of Initial Signals
Initial stimuli associated with weak perpindicular EM fields
and with binding of stimulating molecules at their membrane
receptor sites elicit a HIGHLY COOPERATIVE modification of
Ca++ binding to glycoproteins along the membrane surface.
As noted above, a longitudinal spread is consistent with
the direction of extracellular current flow associated with
physiological activity and imposed EM fields. This cooperative
modification of surface Ca++ binding is an
AMPLIFYING STAGE, with evidence from concurent initial molecular
binding events by imposed RF fields that there is a far greater
increase in Ca++ efflux than is accounted for in the events of
receptor-ligand binding (Bawin and Adey, 1976; Bawin et al,
1975; Liu-Liu and Adey, 1982).

Enzymes are protein molecules that function as catalysts,
initiating and enhancing chemical reactions that would not
otherwise occur at tissue temperatures. This ability resides
in the pattern of electrical charges on the molecular surface.
In the fashion of more familiar chemical catalysts, such as
the hydrocarbon oxidation systems which function only at very
high temperatures in automotive exhaust systems, a catalyst
emerges unchanged from these reactions and is thus able to
participate indefinitely in a specific reaction.
Activation of these enzymes and the reactions in which they
participate involve energies millions of times greater than
in the cell surface cell surface triggering events initiated
by the EM fields, emphasizing the MEMBRANE AMPLIFICATION
inherent in this trans-membrane signaling sequence.

Stimulus Amplification in Cooperative Systems

It is therefore clear that OBSERVED EM field interactions
with cells and tissues based on oscillating ELF tissue gradients
between 10 E-7 and 10 E-1 volts per centimeter would involve
cooperativity MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE GREATER than envisaged in
the examples just cited.
In part this discrepancy appears to relate to far greater
sensitivities to low-frequency EM fields [EW: ELF, that is, the
entrainment frequencies] and to RF fields with low-frequency
amplitude-modulation [EW: this includes radar hearing signals]
than to imposed step functions or DC gradients [EW: common
with contact electrodes, not of interest in mind control at a
distance] used in many electrochemical experiments and models
to test levels of cooperativity in biological systems.
(Blank, 1972)
[EW: In plain language, both entrainment (ELF) fields and
pulsating radar-like (RF) fields are a hell of a lot more
influential on cells than some experimental work using DC
and electrode methods.]

Page 95:
[EW: This section is not part of the demonstration that EM
signals can be biologically amplified, as above. It's main
interest is that a magnetophosphene 'gun' was under consideration
by the U.S. National Institute of Justice in 1993, along
with a 'fever' gun and a 'convulsion'gun, both using microwave
technology. As of 1999, nothing has been heard from NIJ
on this development, however, page 95 here suggests that such
a microwave weapon is feasible.]

<p>
<b><u>Magnetophosphenes</b></u><br>
An effect of time-varying magnetic fields on humans was first
described by d'Arsonval (1896) [EW: Anyone doubt there has
been some progress since 1896?] is the induction of a flickering
illumination within the visual field field known as
magnetophosphenes. This phenomenon occurs as an immediate
response to stimulation by either pulsed or sinusoidal magnetic
fields with frequencies less than 100 Hz, and the effect is
completely reversible with no apparent influence on visual
acuity. The maximum visual sensitivity to sinusoidal magnetic
fields has been found at a frequency of 20 Hz in human subjects
with normal vision.

<br>
[EW: Radio signals are a combination of electric and magnetic
fields. To radiate a 20 Hz signal would require such huge
antennas that it is impractical to do so. I'd recommend that
if someone has the facilities and skills, I'd try some VHF (or
microwave) pulsing at 20 Hz on an RF carrier at, say, the 2-meter
(144-148 MHz) ham band with a duty cycle,
